# Combination of CycleGan and Mcd in Pytorch

This is my PyTorch implementation for semi-supervised un-paired co-training. Although it is not yet been completed, it is nolonger under development.


This package includes [CycleGAN](https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix), [MCD_DA](https://github.com/mil-tokyo/MCD_DA)

The code was written by [Chia-Ming Chang](https://github.com/onedayatatime0923).

**Note**: The current software works well with PyTorch 0.4.

## Prerequisites
- Linux
- NVIDIA GPU + CUDA CuDNN (CPU mode and CUDA without CuDNN may work with minimal modification, but untested)

## Getting Started
### Installation
- Install torch and dependencies from https://github.com/torch/distro
- Install tensorboardX from https://github.com/lanpa/tensorboardX
